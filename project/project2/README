Makefile
----------------------------------------------
Makefile
For command are down below:

For correctness testing:
make
- this command itself would compile the need file and testing files.

make clean
- cleans up all unnecessary files

-----Please use "make" before running any test run for both modes-----

./mysh for interacting mode
./mysh myscript.sh for batch testing mode
----------------------------------------------

Test Plan and Executing (with results)
-----------------------------------------------
Test Plans
1. Entering diffrent mode
    ./mysh
        Welcome to my shell!
        mysh> 

    ./mysh myscript.sh
        sz583@grep:~/CS214/project/project2$ ./mysh myscript.sh
        baz: Bad Command! Setting std_out Twice!
        bar: Bad Command! Setting std_in Twice!
        foo
        ec*o: Bad Command! No matching files!
        ./revline: No such file or directory
        cd: Not a directory
        cd: No such file or directory
        /common/home/sz583/CS214/project/project2
        mysh: exiting
        cd: Not a directory
        cd: No such file or directory
        /common/home/sz583/CS214/project/project2
        mysh: exiting

    result: launched successfully.

2. Prompt Formats
    By inputing command "./mysh" the prompt would pop up and would 
    keep showing after the user entered the something in the command lines
    (e.g., after result pop up the newline with prompt is offered).

3. Command Name/ Wildcard/ Redirection/ Pipes
    All features are implement and test with myscript.sh with these testcase
    and all of the test result are corrected or desirable. The related file 
    can be checked to prove this statement.

    Command list:
    echo foo bar > baz
    echo foo > baz bar
    echo > baz foo bar
    sort < foo > bar
    sort > bar < foo
    echo foo > bar | cat
    echo foo > bar > baz 
    cat < foo < bar 
    echo foo | cat < bar 
    ec*o foo
    pwd > some_file
    pwd | ./revline
    touch foo | cd some_dir     p.s. non conflicted but did both
    cd some_dir | pwd           p.s. conflicted but did both
    touch foo | exit            p.s. priorizing function that is not exit

    Results:
    sz583@grep:~/CS214/project/project2$ ./mysh myscript.sh
    baz: Bad Command! Setting std_out Twice!
    bar: Bad Command! Setting std_in Twice!
    foo
    ec*o: Bad Command! No matching files!
    ./revline: No such file or directory
    cd: Not a directory
    cd: No such file or directory
    /common/home/sz583/CS214/project/project2
    mysh: exiting
    cd: Not a directory
    cd: No such file or directory
    /common/home/sz583/CS214/project/project2
    mysh: exiting
